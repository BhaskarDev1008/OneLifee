## Our Vision üí°  

One Life aims to streamline healthcare by solving challenges faced by both patients and doctors:  

- **For Patients:**  
  - Simplifies the process of booking appointments with doctors registered in the app.  
  - Prioritizes patients based on urgency rather than a "First Come First Serve" system, ensuring fairness.  
  - Allows users to upload prescriptions for doctors to review directly through the app.  
  - Offers health monitoring features by displaying key metrics in an easy-to-read chart.  

- **For Doctors:**  
  - Provides an organized queue based on patient priority.  
  - Eliminates the awkwardness of discussing fees by integrating instant payment options with QR codes.  
  - Offers access to patient prescriptions and health data in real-time.

## Key Features üéØ  

- **Appointment Booking:**  
  Users can search for doctors by name, phone number, or email to book appointments. Patients answer a few questions about their condition, and the system confirms the appointment seamlessly.  

- **Priority-Based Appointment Sorting:**  
  Our algorithm analyzes patient data and prioritizes the queue based on urgency, ensuring fair treatment for all patients.  

- **Prescription Management:**  
  Patients can upload their latest prescriptions, which doctors can access directly via the app, eliminating the need to carry physical documents.  

- **Health Statistics:**  
  Users can track their health metrics, with the app displaying a chart of the last five records for easy monitoring.  

- **Instant UPI Payment Integration:**  
  Doctors can set their fee details, and the app generates a QR code for payments, ensuring a professional and hassle-free transaction process.  

- **Appointment & Queue Management:**  
  Users can view their list of appointments, while doctors can manage a sorted queue of patients based on priority.
